## Abstract
This repository contains an ethnographic study to understand the prevalence of mental health issues in tech industry and the measures adopted by workplaces to address these issues. It is an exploratory data analysis using survey results from respondents working in tech published by OSMI in 2019. The analysis suggests that about 84% of the respondents find the support to be inadequate and 60% may have experienced mental health issues at some point. More than 50% do not have medical coverage for mental health issues and 70% respondents shared that there are not enough forums to discuss and seek help on such topics. Majority also stated that employers give more importance to physical health over mental health and more than 50% respondents do not feel completely comfortable asking for leaves for mental health issues. Overall, the study indicates that there is significant room for improvement in addressing mental health issues and overcoming the stigma around having open discussions about mental health.

## Research Questions
The key research area of this project is to understand the provisions at tech workplaces to address mental health issues in employees:
  - Do employees feel that the tech industry supports mental health and wellbeing?
  - How many respondents have experienced mental health problems or are currently being diagnosed?
  - Are employers providing healthcare benefits for mental health issues? 
  - Are employees aware of their healthcare benefits and resources?
  - How do employers weigh mental health issues at the same level as to other medical issues?
  - Are there any leave policies for those suffering from mental health issues?
